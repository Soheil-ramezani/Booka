This website is an e-commerce website specializing in book sales, built using Vue 3 and Tailwind CSS. In this project, I mainly focused on developing most of the functions that are used by the user. One of the challenges I faced was establishing a connection between local storage and different pages, as well as transferring data between various pages in different scenarios.
